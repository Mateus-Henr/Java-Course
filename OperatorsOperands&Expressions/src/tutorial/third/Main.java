    // Associativity
    // It is the direction of execution of operators and can be either left to right or right to left.
    // If operators have the same precedence, associativity is used to decide the order of execution.
    // Addition and subtraction are left-associative. Most of them go in this package.
    // Ex: 16 - 8 + 5
    // Assignment operator is right-associative.
    // Ex: int numberTrucks = 5;
