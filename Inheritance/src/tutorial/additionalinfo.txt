Reference vs Object vs Instance vs Class

A class is a blueprint of a house for example, we can build as many houses as we like using that class.

Each house you build (in other words instantiate using the new operator) is an object also known as an instance.

Each house you build has an address in other words a reference.

You can copy that reference as many times as you like but there's still just one house. In other words we are
copying the paper that has address on it not the house itself.

We can pass references as parameters to constructors and methods.
