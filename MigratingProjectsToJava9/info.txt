This project is the "music.ui" project from the course. It has been reused to show how you could update it to Java 9.
Also, we are separating stuff in the modules being them database, UI and models.
Each module requires its own libraries, also you have to inform the "exports", "opens" and "requires" in the
"module-info.java".
You can click "Alt" + "Enter" where the errors are to identify what you need to do in the project, or you can just
let IntelliJ try to fix the errors fo you. When it's missing libraries you can go to the "Problems" tab and click on
"Fix" and when it's a problem with missing something in the module just use those keys and select IntelliJ suggestions.
