# Java-Course

- This project was based on a Java course that I took on Udemy called "Java Programming Masterclass covering Java 11 & Java 17" ("https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/"). The content of the course covers from variables to networking using Java.
- The course is hosted by Tim Bulchalka, a professional software developer with almost 40 years of career. Due to that most projects contain a considerable amount of comments having as purpose explaining terms and best practices for future reference.
- Each project name is related to a class of the course, therefore, for parts that are coded along with the host, the packages were named as "tutorial" and the exercises performed throughout the course, the packages were called "challenge".
- OBS: For certain projects, some external files are required, they can either be found in the "bin" folder or they have to be downloaded on the Internet.
